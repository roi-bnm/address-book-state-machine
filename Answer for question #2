The condition D, that says that a trusted business card can never become an untrusted business card makes a flaw in the diagram.
The flaw is that a trusted business card can be stuck on Pending Verification state.
In case strong verification is failed for a trusted business card, it stays in the Pending Verification state without
the ability to go back to the initial state.

In order to fix the flaw, I'm suggesting to add Abort action also for the trusted business card which will move
the trusted business card state back to the initial state - Known
(adding an Abort arrow from Pending Verification state to Known state).

In the Pending Verification state, in case the strong verification failed, we will check the type of the business card
and call Abort which will move the business card to the previous state accordingly.
